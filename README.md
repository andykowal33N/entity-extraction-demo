# Entity Extraction Demo

Multilingual entity extraction demo comparing LLM and spaCy pipelines for identity and risk analysis. Shows alias linking, normalization, and structured output for vetting and due-diligence workflows.

## Overview
This project benchmarks modern AI and NLP models for extracting people, organizations, and locations from open-source or investigative text. It highlights how multilingual entity resolution supports continuous vetting and risk intelligence missions.

## Features
- Compare LLM vs. spaCy extraction accuracy  
- Test multilingual text (English, Spanish, Arabic, Cyrillic)  
- Demonstrate alias linking and entity normalization  
- Export entities to JSON for downstream analytics
